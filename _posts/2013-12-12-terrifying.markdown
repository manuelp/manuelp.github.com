[![Release It!](http://imagery.pragprog.com/products/93/mnee_xlargecover.jpg?1298589747)](http://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it)

I haven't finished it yet, and I already think it's a foundamental read for every professional software developer. Along with, for example:

* [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer)
* [Practices Of An Agile Developer](http://pragprog.com/book/pad/practices-of-an-agile-developer)
