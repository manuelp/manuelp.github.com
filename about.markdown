# Who am I? #
My name is Manuel Paccagnella, I'm a 20-something and work in Italy as a software developer in a small company that does consulting and develops software solutions for local businesses. 

In my day job I work mainly with Java and its ecosystem, but I have a great passion an curiosity for the world of programming and I'm constantly learning. My current interests are: functional programming (LISP, Clojure), OO (Smalltalk, Io), all thing "agile" and a zillion of other things.
