Welcome! My name is Manuel Paccagnella, and I'm your host for this blog. I was born in 1986 and now, a bunch of years later, I work in Italy as a software developer in a small company that creates software solutions for local businesses.

In my day job I work mainly with Java and Javascript, but I have a great passion and curiosity for the world of software development and Iâ€™m constantly learning. I'm particularly interested in functional programming, and right now I'm fond of [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/) and [Clojure](http://clojure.org/). If you attended EuroClojure 2012 you have probably saw me there :)

I like to read, study, write [some](https://github.com/manuelp) [code](https://bitbucket.org/manuelp), and occasionally post on this blog.
